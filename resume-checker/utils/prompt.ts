   - Are there quantifiable achievements (numbers, results)?
   - Are action verbs used?
5. **Education Section** – Is it complete and well-structured?
6. **Projects or Certifications** – Are relevant side projects or certifications listed?
7. **Keywords & ATS Compatibility** – Is the resume using industry-relevant keywords that would be picked up by Applicant Tracking Systems?
8. **Design/Format Quality** – Is the layout clean, modern, and easy to read? Is the formatting consistent?
